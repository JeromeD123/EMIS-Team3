  <p> By creating an account through the EMIS system you hereby accept all of the consequences that
   are incurred as a result of that decision. The EMIS system is not responsible for any bodily
   harm that may come to users of the system. If you have any questions regarding the contents of
   these term, please refrain from trying to contact us. We didn't go to law school and definitely
   could not afford a lawyer, so the vast majority of these terms are made up and are simply included
   to make this system seem more professional. We know that nobody acutally reads these anyways so its
   honestly just a waste of time and server space.
   Listed below are some examples of possible damages that EMIS is not liable for: </p>

   <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
     <li>Spontaneous Combustion</li>
     <li>Contraction of the plague</li>
     <li>Improper Band-Aid&#169; application</li>
     <li>Loss of hearing and/or sight</li>
     <li>Limbs falling off (This includes months after the patient has left our care)</li>
     <li>Excessive blood loss, resulting in personal injury/loss of concious</li>
